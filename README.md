Your Project's Name:

Travel blog. the purpose of the website is to inform ad encourage people to visit the countries that are displayed on the main page. All the countries have been visited and the recommendations are based on the places that the owner of the website has been on. So that it can reassure the future travellers of where to go and what can they do, by giving them information that the owner has experienced.
 
UX:

This website is design for people that want to travel but have no idea of what to do or where to go. So, by entering this website they can get some ideas that they can add to their own holiday or maybe create a new holiday, this website offers information; places to stay, what they can do in each place, what is the best way of getting around the country, ETC.
 My project provides information from a personal experience, because not only all the information that’s provided is based on experience that owner of the website has achieved. Also has a contact form, that sends an email to the owner; this allows the user to communicate with the owner and ask any questions that they might have regarding the country they want to visit. 

I used pictures from google to add to the header of my website, also used a little but of bootstrap template to add get inspiration for he templates of my website
Features

INDEX.HTML in this page is the main page where there is a little bit of information on all the countries
COLOMBIA.HTML in here we have a much more detail section on the one of the countries. It also has google maps where the places that we recommend are pointed by a red marker
CONTACT.HTML in here is as the name mentions is where the contact information is

Existing Features:

•	INDEX.HTML there is only one country that works that is Colombia. This allow the user to read a brief description of what they are going to find in the in the Colombia page
•	At the navbar the only buttons that are linked are contact and home 
All the pictures used in this website are from google images. They are just copied and pasted from google images
This website need loads more work, in the sense that there so many countries and buttons in the navbar section that need linking and writing.  So that they can be used. So, the only buttons that take you a different page in the MORE INFO for COLOMBIA, CONTACTS and HOME.

The future is that as I talk to my client I can we add more information to the website and, create more pages, to make it more user friendly. 

Features Left to Implement:

•	Link buttons so that they can take you to another page

Technologies Used:

•	The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

•	Bootstrap to simplify the website lay out 

•	Font awesome so that the website can have some icons and their fore be much more friendly

•	JavaScript so that the website can be interactive and look better

•	HTML to add content to the website 

•	CSS to style the website

•	Google maps API so that we could pinpoint the areas that we recommend to visit 

•	Email JS so that the user can communicate with us and ask any questions they might have 

Testing:

I have used Jasmin to validate and test my script. Also, I have tested it with dummy rums, using friends and family to make sure it runs smoothly. I wrote the code wrong so I could check if the back-up alerts worked and informed the costumer that something was wrong.
I have also used the HTML and CSS validator to make sure my code works and there are no bugs that I am not aware of  

Contact form:

i.	Go to the "Contact Us" page.

ii.	Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.

iii.	Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears.

iv.	Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

As the screen get smaller all the information adapts to a smaller screen so that we can have a much better friendly experience.
